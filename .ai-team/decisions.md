### 2026-02-19: Projection Mapping Implementation (consolidated)

**By:** Ekko, Mylo  
**What:** Defined projection mapping color scheme and test strategy. Black background (0,0,0) with white features (255,255,255) as standard. Comprehensive test suite covers colors, contrast (15:1 minimum), all expression states, and edge cases.  
**Why:** Projection mapping requires maximum contrast — black prevents projector light bleed, white features at maximum brightness ensure clear illumination. Proactive testing enables parallel development and ensures all six expressions work reliably in projection mode.
