## Learnings

📌 Team update (2026-02-19): Projection mapping color scheme and test strategy finalized — decided by Ekko, Mylo

*Patterns, conventions, insights about testing, quality, and edge cases.*

### Test Infrastructure
- Created test_projection_mapping.py with comprehensive test suite for Issue #1
- Uses pytest framework with fixtures for pygame surface initialization
- Test classes organized by concern: Colors, Contrast, Expressions, Feature Completeness, Edge Cases

### Testing Patterns for Pygame Graphics
- Pixel sampling strategy: use sparse sampling (every 20th pixel) for performance
- Fixture pattern: init pygame, create surface, yield to test, quit pygame
- Color validation: use get_at() to sample specific coordinates
- Contrast testing: calculate luminance and ratio using WCAG formulas

### Projection Mapping Requirements (Issue #1)
- Background must be pure black (0,0,0) - no gray values
- Features (eyes, mouth) must be pure white (255,255,255)
- Minimum contrast ratio: 15:1 for reliable projection
- No intermediate colors allowed - binary black/white only
- All six expressions must work in projection mode

### Key Test Coverage Areas
- Color validation at multiple sample points (corners, edges, center)
- Contrast ratio calculation and validation (>15:1 required)
- All expression states (neutral, happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared)
- Expression transitions maintain projection colors
- Feature completeness (two eyes, mouth visible)
- Multiple resolutions (800x600, 1920x1080, 1024x768, 640x480)
- Rapid expression changes

### Test Implementation Notes
- Tests contain TODO markers for projection_mode flag (awaiting Ekko's implementation)
- Eye/mouth coordinate sampling uses approximate positions - may need adjustment
- Parametrized tests for all six expression states
- Edge case tests for resolution independence and rapid changes
